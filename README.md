# Dice Game ðŸŽ²

## Project Overview
Dice Game is a simple, fun two-player game where each player races to reach 100 points based on dice rolls. Itâ€™s built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and allows players to practice decision-making as they roll the dice to increase their scores. The first player to reach a total score of 100 points wins the game!

## How to Play
1. **Objective**: Be the first player to reach 100 points.
2. **Rolling the Dice**: Players take turns rolling a dice.
   - If the dice shows a number between 2-6, that number is added to the playerâ€™s *current round score*.
   - If the dice shows a 1, the player loses all points for the current round, and their turn ends.
3. **Holding**: Players can choose to "hold" at any time, adding their *current round score* to their *total score*. This ends their turn and passes play to the other player.
4. **Winning**: The first player to reach or exceed 100 points in their total score wins the game.

## Features
- **Interactive UI**: The game interface shows the current scores, round scores, and allows players to roll or hold.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Simple but engaging rules that add strategy and excitement with each roll.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with HTML and CSS, optimized for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structuring the game elements.
- **CSS** for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** for game logic and interactivity.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Start playing!

## Future Improvements
Some potential enhancements could include:
